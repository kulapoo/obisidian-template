# Home ðŸŒŽ

This document encompasses all notes. This is the base location for all notes. Each note has its own Map of contents or MOC

# Map of Contents

```dataview

# Note workflow

- Notes in the inbox must be processed.
- Ask yourself the following: Is the note interesting? Does it require a summary? Is it relevant?
- If so, categorize it as a [[Literature note]] or place it in [[Someday maybe]] for potential future relevance.
- If a note qualifies as an [[Atomic - Permanent Note]], it can bypass the [[Literature note]] and [[Someday maybe]] stages.
- Highlights from books, quotes, or wise words from individuals should be moved to the [[Raw]] folder."
