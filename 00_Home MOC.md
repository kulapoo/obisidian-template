# Home ðŸŒŽ

This document encompasses all notes. This is the base location for all notes. Each note has its own Map of contents or MOC

# Map of Contents

```dataview
list
from #map 
sort file.name asc
```

# Note workflow

- Notes must be processed - #input
- Ask yourself the following: Is the note interesting? Does it require a summary? Is it relevant?
- If so, categorize it as a [[Literature note]] using #info/reference  tag or place it in [[Someday maybe]]   #status/backlog  tag for potential future relevance.
- If a note qualifies as an [[Atomic - Permanent Note]] use #output  i.e #output/article , it can bypass the [[Literature note]] and [[Someday maybe]] stages.
- Highlights from books, quotes, or wise words from individuals should be moved to the [[Raw]]  #info/raw folder.
- With the help of templater plugin, we can easily create notes using these templates
	- [[note]] - This will create a note with #input tag
	- [[daily]]
	- [[event]]
	- [[meeting]]
	- [[people]]
	- [[reference]] - This will create a note with #info/reference tag
