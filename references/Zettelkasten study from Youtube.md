# Types of notes - Vicky Zhao
- Fleeting notes - everyday thoughts, like when in a shower, walking , aha moments
- Literature / Reference - thoughts while consuming content 
	- for books, articles, watching utube or movies, listen to songs or podcast
	- 3 rules
		has to be brief (or an atomic idea 1 - 5 sentences)
		in your own words
		track references to know where it came from
- Permanent Notes
	- this is created by reviewing literature and fleeting notes
	- 3 rules
		- 1 atomic idea
		- Express the idea clearly, assuming the reader has no context
		- connect the permanent notes idea with other notes

## Workflow 
1. Capture notes
2. Process notes
3. Connect notes
4. Produce output
5. Gather reactions & conversations


## Capture notes 
- Capturing fleeting notes (epiphany, sudden idea like when walking)
- Capturing literature notes (anything you can consume - books, utube, etc.)
- Write everything that is interesting to you without judging it, no matter what it is. The reason is 
	1. We can actively practice observing thoughts
	2. We can't judge the usefulness of an idea statistically


## Processing notes
- Make notes atomic
	- 3 categories
		- Questions
		- Ideas
		- Supplementary tools (support the idea like anecdote, studies about the topic or idea)
- Make notes search friendly through tags and keywords


## Connect 
- idea compass
	- West: Similar
	- East: Opposite
	- North: Theme / Question
	- South: What/Where does this lead to
