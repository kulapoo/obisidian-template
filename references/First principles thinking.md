First principles thinking is a mode of inquiry borrowed from physics, particularly popularized in recent years by people like Elon Musk. It involves breaking down problems and ideas into their most basic and fundamental truths or elements, and then reconstructing the solution or concept from the ground up. By doing this, individuals or organizations can sidestep conventional wisdom or inherited assumptions and approach problems with a fresh, foundational perspective.

To elucidate, here's a simplified process of applying first principles thinking:

1. **Identify the Problem or Concept**: Clearly state what you're trying to understand or the problem you're trying to solve.
    
2. **Break It Down to the Basics**: Deconstruct the problem or concept into its most fundamental truths or elements. These are things that are almost universally true, not based on convention or tradition.
    
    - Example: If you're trying to understand how to create a cheaper battery, instead of comparing existing batteries, you'd start by asking, "What are the basic materials and conditions necessary for storing electrical energy?"
3. **Reconstruct the Solution**: Using these foundational elements, think of new ways to approach the problem or understand the concept. This step involves creative synthesis. You’re taking the foundational truths you’ve identified and combining them in novel ways.
    
    - Using the battery example: By understanding the basic materials and conditions for storing energy, can you find more abundant/cheaper materials or more efficient processes?
4. **Analyze and Test**: Once you've devised a potential solution or a new understanding of the concept, you'll want to test it, refine it, and ensure it's viable or accurate.
    

The power of first principles thinking lies in its ability to sidestep analogy (i.e., doing something because it's how it’s always been done) and instead dive deep into a problem or concept to develop innovative solutions or new understandings.

In the real world, using first principles can be more time-consuming than reasoning by analogy, but it can lead to breakthroughs and new, often more efficient ways of doing things.
