# About
Permanent notes are explanations of a single idea, annotated with
metadata about the subject of the note, other notes that note is
related to, and the source of the note.
You usually write permanent notes using literature notes as your
source. You take only the most important ideas from your literature
notes, and turn them into singular notes you can connect with other
notes. Once you have many permanent notes, you can construct a
rough draft for an entire article or book.
Permanent notes are the ultimate destination within your
Zettelkasten for the best ideas you have or come across. In fact,
your permanent notes are your Zettelkasten. The permanent note is
the last stop for an idea before you synthesize it into something new.


this is created by reviewing literature and fleeting notes


## 3 rules

- 1 atomic idea
- Express the idea clearly, assuming the reader has no context
- connect the permanent notes idea with other notes
