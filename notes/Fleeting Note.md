# About
Fleeting notes are notes you take "on the fly." They're casual, and
may be disorganized. You can take fleeting notes on cocktail
napkins, slips of paper, a note-taking app on your phone, in a paper
notebook, or even in the margins of your books. Highlights on an
ebook reader even qualify as fleeting notes.

All fleeting note should have "input" tag
