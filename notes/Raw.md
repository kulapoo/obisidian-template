# About 

Storing the "raw," exported highlights from books or
articles. You'll be condensing these highlights, but sometimes those
condensed highlights aren't enough. Maybe you search for a word
that was in the source material, but didn't make it into your
condensed highlights. Maybe there's an exact passage you want to
reference, but you didn't keep that passage word-for-word in your
literature notes or permanent notes
