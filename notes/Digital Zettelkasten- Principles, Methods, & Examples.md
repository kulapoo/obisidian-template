## Highlights

> Literature notes are informal summaries you write about a piece of media you've consumed. Whether you've read a book or an article, listened to a podcast, watched a documentary, or had a conversation with an expert, a literature note is something you can review to remind you of the main points you learned [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#e01d9094-e325-408a-a8e8-35564e4bdadd)  ^e01d9094

> Once you've exported your highlights, review them and highlight, once again, the parts of those highlights that are the most interesting [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#d1ed7301-e10b-48d4-adea-e76b35ce26da)  ^d1ed7301

>  humans have been prone to distractions for all of recorded history [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#6ebf29e0-4ff2-4900-813b-a08fdacdca19)  ^6ebf29e0

> Inbox is where I put fleeting notes that need to be processed. It may contain thoughts I've written down, something a friend has recommended I look up, or highlights from my reading. Processing the contents of the inbox will be a regular ritual in managing your Zettelkasten. Someday/Maybe is borrowed from the Getting Things Done productivity system. You often come across things that are interesting, but not interesting enough and/or not relevant enough to your current projects to investigate further. The "someday/maybe" designation helps reduce worries that the idea might fall through the cracks, without obligating you to follow up on the idea right now. Raw is for storing the "raw," exported highlights from books or articles. You'll be condensing these highlights, but sometimes those condensed highlights aren't enough. Maybe you search for a word that was in the source material, but didn't make it into your condensed highlights. Maybe there's an exact passage you want to reference, but you didn't keep that passage word-for-word in your literature notes or permanent notes. By keeping the raw highlights in your database, you can search and quickly find the exact passage [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#91013c74-2212-4695-ba90-7a20dd69e322)  ^91013c74

> You take only the most important ideas from your literature notes, and turn them into singular notes you can connect with other notes [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#d2342ddc-a02c-44fa-828d-2a1f640a2e10)  ^d2342ddc

> The Heart to Start: Stop Procrastinating &amp; Start Creating) [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#cb8127e6-d219-447d-8209-08415bb7d671)  ^cb8127e6

> Permanent notes are the ultimate destination within your Zettelkasten for the best ideas you have or come across [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#2c3dd38c-6875-44da-bcff-45b32b2b6d34)  ^2c3dd38c

> your permanent notes are your Zettelkasten [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#c69875d2-6b32-4c8d-9925-8a1373cfd2a4)  ^c69875d2

> the proper way to take notes is not to copy things word-for-word (except in the case of exact quotes). Instead, you re-write it in your own words, which is even more powerful. Second, you don't write down everything you read. You only write down the important things: Things that are interesting, relevant to your work, or that you otherwise want to retain [⤴️](https://omnivore.app/me/u-b-90-f-41-ce-438-a-11-ee-9-c-63-43183791-b-49-c-digital-zettel-18a2e8193cf#56f2cd85-9ff3-418c-b374-93db9db2641e)  ^56f2cd85
